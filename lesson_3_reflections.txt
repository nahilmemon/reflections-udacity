When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository when
    - you are working on the same project with other people.
    - you want your to be publicly available so that you can easily show other people what you're working on.
    - you want your work to be open source.
    - you are working on the same project from more than one computer/laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to always pull changes manually if you are working on something and are not ready to merge your changes with what's available on GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is made when you want to split up your commit history so that it is no longer linear. This can only take place within one repository.
    A clone is made when you want to copy a repository. You can clone a repository from GitHub onto your local computer/laptop. You can also clone a repository from one location on your computer/laptop to another location on the same computer/laptop.
    A fork is made when you want to copy (clone) a repository from someone else's GitHub account directly into your own GitHub account.
